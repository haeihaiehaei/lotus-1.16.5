# LOTUS modpack for 1.16.5 Forge
Source for my 1.16.5 modpack that is under development.

Small kitchen sink pack made for me and my friends but will be shared with others. It will contain a major range of different mods, both technic and magical. A lot of effort has been put into the overworld! There is a bunch of different dimensions to visit and tons of stuff to do. Stay tuned!

**Todo:** 
- Configure oregen
- Fix combability issues with Sodium Forge version
- Loot tables
 
**Current Issues:**
- World creation is slooooooow, it may seems like it´s hanging but be patient it´s worth the wait! Will try to fix the performance of BYG in an upcoming version
- Worldgen is buggy with some biomes being straight edges
