# LOTUS-1.16.5
Source for my 1.16.5 modpack that is under development.

Small kitchen sink pack made for me and my friends but will be shared with others. It will contain a major range of different mods, both technic and magical. A lot of effort has been put into the overworld! There is a bunch of different dimensions to visit and tons of stuff to do. Stay tuned!

 

First Alpha build should be up in a few days. Server files will follow.

 

This is a very heavy pack so please allow at least 8Gb of RAM and use Java 11 (11.0.10 currently tested) if you want to make use of the ModernUI mod..

 

Todo: 

Configure oregen.
Fix combability issues with Sodium Forge version.
Loot tables.
 

Current Issues:

World creation is slooooooow, it may seems like it´s hanging but be patient it´s worth the wait! Will try to fix the performance of BYG in an upcoming version.
Worldgen is buggy with some biomes being straight edges.
